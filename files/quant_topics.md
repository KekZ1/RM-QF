## Mix and Match for new contribution (The combinations are unlimited !)
* Model + Product
* Model + Method
* Model + Trading Strategy
* XXX + China Market Data

## Caution
  * Stochastic Process
    * What is the characteristics of stochastic processes? 
    * Why are they popular? What are the strength/weakness?
  * Derivatives
    * What is the economic background of the derivative products?
    * Why certain products are popular?

# Buy Side Research
* Asset management, Portfolio allocation, Trading strategy.
* Sometimes the outcome is not published as academic research.

## Portfolio Selection/Optimization
* Minimum variance portfolio 
* Smart Beta (factor investing)
* Risk parity portfolio ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_parity); Equal Risk Contribution): very popular in asset management industry.

* Can machine learning predict outperforming strategy given economic situation?
* Consider uncommon asset class (e.g., not equity): commodity, interest rates, FX, etc.

## Caution
* Just showing good performance of strategy is NOT enough. 
* Either need add academic connection or show effort.

## Financial Machine Learning:
* Current focus is in asset pricing (return prediction)
* You may often need massive data + computation power. Check availability before! 
* Often there are room for simple but good idea. Consider Replacing linear regression with ML methods?
* Software tool is readily available (sklearn, keras/tensorflow, pytorch, etc)
* Extra new information with Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
* ML method may help you future career!

### Other Thesis Examples
* Long, Shuyi (2019). **Smart Beta Investing: A New Method Based on Machine Learning and Black-Litterman Model** [Mathesis]. Peking University HSBC Business School.
  * Used the probability outcome of ML as in input of the Black-Litterman (asset management) model 
* Ge, Desheng (2020). **How can the yield curve predict an economic recession?** [Mathesis]. Peking University HSBC Business School.
  * The negative US Treasury yield spread (e.g., 10y - 3m) is considered as the best recession indicator. This paper verify that the yield curve spread (long - short) is indeed the best recession indicator. But the pair and coefficients can be slightly different.
